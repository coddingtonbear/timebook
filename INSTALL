Installation
============

To install timebook, run the following command from the mercurial
repository::

    python setup.py install

This will install timebook to the default location on your system. To
install to a different directory, supply setup.py with the ``--prefix``
option. For details, refer to ``python setup.py install --help`` and the
python setuptools documentation.

Alternatively, you can copy or symlink the ``timebook`` subdirectory to
a directory on your python path, and copy or symlink the ``t``
executable to a directory on your ``PATH``. This facilitates updating
through mercurial.
